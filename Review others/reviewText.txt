Hello! Unless I completely misunderstood the point of this exercise, it is VERY hard and it requires a bunch of stuff we have not seen in this course (reading files, for example).

Nevertheless, I will judge this based on what was asked, as I reckon the moderators can intervene and clarify in case everyone gets bad results haha.

Either way, the problem is, as I understand it: code a program that will read the attached file and return the average of the numbers.

Your code doesn't read the file, nor is it ready to be fed it via the command line (eg: opening the terminal and running your program with something like "cat file.txt | .\program").
So it doesn't really do what was asked.

Now, besides that, I would also like to point out that you are storing the average in a double variable, but the calculation side uses only integers, so the result throws away the part of the number after the point.
With the kind of calculation you used and this problem itself it won't change the result much, but it is something to keep in mind!

Since your code was well organized and commented I gave full marks on the criteria other than correctness and "all criteria at a high standard".

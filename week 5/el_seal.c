Peer-graded Assignment: Compute the average weight for a population of elephant seals read into an array

In this peer reviewed assignment, you will use an array to calculate an average from raw dataâ€”specifically the average weight of the northern elephant seal (Mirounga angustirostris).
You will submit a file with your program for your fellow learners to review, and you will review three of your fellow learners' programs.
